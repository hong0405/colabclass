# Active Context: Ubiquity DAO Hub

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on maintaining and improving the Ubiquity DAO Hub website. We have successfully addressed the Node.js deprecation warning related to the `@react-icons/all-files` package and set up comprehensive documentation for the project.

## Recent Changes
- Initial setup of the Memory Bank documentation system
- Fixed the deprecation warning for the `@react-icons/all-files` package by modifying its package.json file
- Created the .clinerules file to document project patterns and preferences

## Next Steps
1. Consider implementing automated testing to ensure site reliability
2. Explore performance optimizations for better user experience
3. Enhance accessibility features to make the site more inclusive
4. Keep dependencies up-to-date to maintain security and functionality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Dependency Management Strategy
We need to decide on the best approach for handling the deprecated package:
- **Update Strategy**: Prefer updating to newer versions when available
- **Override Strategy**: Use package.json overrides for quick fixes when updates aren't available
- **Fork Strategy**: Consider forking dependencies only as a last resort

### Documentation Approach
We're establishing a comprehensive Memory Bank documentation system to ensure:
- Clear understanding of the project's purpose and architecture
- Easy onboarding for new developers
- Tracking of progress and issues
- Documentation of technical decisions and patterns

### Development Workflow
- Use bun to run TypeScript files directly without compilation
- Use bun for package installation
- Maintain the existing ESLint configuration unless specifically asked to change it
- Assume .env files are properly configured when running the application

## Current Challenges

### Technical Challenges
- Ensuring compatibility with future Next.js versions
- Maintaining performance while addressing technical debt
- Implementing automated testing for better reliability

### Project Challenges
- Keeping documentation up-to-date as the project evolves
- Balancing new features with maintenance tasks
- Ensuring the site remains up-to-date with the latest Notion content

## Immediate Priorities
1. Explore opportunities for automated testing
2. Monitor for any new deprecation warnings or issues
3. Keep dependencies up-to-date
4. Consider performance optimizations for better user experience
